# What's this?

This is the readme of Richard Siu Kit Wong aka Kit. I see this as the getting started guide on me as an Engineering Manager. If you’re in my team, I hope you find this a helpful way to understand what I care about and what I believe in. This is also a transparent way for you to keep me honest. 

Please challenge me if you see me act in ways that contradict what I wrote below. Issue/PR accepted.

# About Me

I’m Chinese born in Hong Kong but have been a Londoner for more than 10 years. I’m a foodie and a coffee drinker. 

My goal as engineering manager is to help and support the team to build great products that users loves.

I’m here to give you as much context as possible so you know why and how your actions are important to the team, product and business. I’m here to help you succeed which means I will do everything I can do unblock you and create the environment you need to do your best work. This would includes getting through bureaucracy, advocate for you/team, and improving team processes/culture.

# One to Ones

At minimum, I will have a 30mins weekly 121 with all my direct reports. In general, this is not a session for you to give me a status report on your week. I’ve many ways to find out what you’re working on if I want a statue report. This is a chance for us to have meaningful conversations about specific issues you’re having and how I can help, feedback on me/team/project for us to action on, and a way to get feedback from me. From time to time, we would talk about the future, where you want to go in future. This is also a good time for you to ask me about anything that is on your mind.

On top of regular 121, as you are the most important part of my job, if you need me on anything, Slack is the fastest way. And I will always make time for you in person.

# Trust

I fundamental believe that my role as manager is not to approve your work. You’re here because I trust your skills and ability to do your job. Once in a while, I will think you’re heading in the wrong direction, I will tell you and have a discussion about it, but I see this as mutually learning.

My default position is to trust you to make decisions and take actions to achieve our goals and not check in with me every time. Sure, please do ask for my opinion or advice when needed. But I’ve a bias toward actions. So I’m totally ok if you check-in with me after you’ve done something. However, trust goes both ways and I still expect you to get consensus, agreement, and input from your teammates.

# Value & Believes in Software Development
- Software Development is a team sport. Team over individual.
- I believe in Agile Manifesto (http://agilemanifesto.org/) but not wedded to any processes (Scrum/Kanban)
- I value your time and focus. I don’t want to disrupt your flow or waste any time on process/meetings that don’t benefit you.
- I value action over inaction. The more you do, the more you learn. This applies to product development and personal development. Experimentation is key!

# Feedback

I’m very open and value feedback a lot. If you feel like I am not adhering to the words written above or could do better in my job, please give me that honest and direct feedback.
